# Game Time Starter Kit (FE - Module 2)

Game Time featuring CENTIPEDE

*We were tasked with making full-featured game using React and Canvas. We were required to include sufficient UX to allow the user to fully interact with the game. This would include:

Indicate when the game is over and won or lost
Allow the user to start a new game
Display a score (if applicable)
Include a clean UI surrounding the actual game interface itself (this might include instructions on how to play, a high score saved in localStorage, etc. Think of what would be most intuitive for your particular game.)
Include multiple levels of difficulty

*The UI of the game should be clean, intuitive, and informative:

tell the user when the game is over (due to losing, winning, or completing the game)
tell the user the score or number of lives remaining (if applicable)
allow the user to start a new game.

Once the server is running, visit in your browser:

* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` to run your application.
* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/test.html` to run your test suite in the browser.
